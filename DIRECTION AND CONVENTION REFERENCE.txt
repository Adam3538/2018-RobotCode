To Drive the robot forward: 
Lmotor = 1
Rmotor = 1

To turn the robot clockwise:
Lmotor = 1
Rmotor = -1

To turn the robot counterclockwise: 
Lmotor = 1
Rmotor = -1

(right motor is inverted)

Elevator convention: 
When raising the elevator: 
ElevatorMotor1 = 1
ElevatorMotor2 = 1
ElevatorEncoder = Increasing in a positive direction

When lowering the elevator: 
ElevatorMotor1 = -1
ElevatorMotor2 = -1
ElevatorEncoder = Decreasing in a negative direction until 0

(ElevatorMotor2 is inverted)

Wrist convention: 
When looking at the side of the elevator with the wrist mounted 
To rotate wrist to right position (Position 1):
WristMotor = 1
Encoder = Increasing in a positive direction

Claw Convention: 
Intake:
Claw motor = 1
Claw Clamp = off

Eject: 
Claw motor = -1
Claw Clamp = fwd

Drop: 
Claw motor = 0
Claw Clamp = reverse

Hold (default state):
Claw motor = 0
Claw Clamp = fwd
